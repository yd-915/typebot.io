# Introduction

Typebot currently offers 2 APIs: **Builder** and **Chat**

## Builder

The Builder API is about what you can edit on https://app.typebot.io (i.e. create typebots, insert blocks etc, get results...). It is currently under active development and new endpoints will be added incrementally.

## Chat

:::caution
You should not use it in production. This API is experimental at the moment and will be changed without notice.
:::

The Chat API allows you to execute (chat) with a typebot.
